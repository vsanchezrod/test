    PRODUCT1: "CTX-10 pH Minus - 5kg (74650). To lower and adjust pH values to 7,4, add 2,25 kg of CTX-10 pH Minus. This will improve bathing comfort by preventing eye and mucous membrane irritation and preserving the skin's natural protective layer. It will also optimize disinfectant efficiency and prevent lime scale build-up.",
    PRODUCT2: "CTX-200GR ClorShock - 1kg (03135). To recover the water, perform superchlorination by adding 1 kg of CTX-200GR ClorShock into the skimmer. Then activate the filtration system, allowing the product to dissolve as water circulates through the skimmer. Alternatively, you can evenly spread the product across the pool surface. This product offers quick dissolution, and its high solubility ensures the required level of residual chlorine is quickly achieved.",
    PRODUCT3: "CTX-400 ClorProtect - 4.5kg (73127). To keep the water disinfected for longer, add 1,5 kg of CTX-400 Clor Protect to the skimmer or pump pre-filter, keeping the filtration system on. This chlorine stabilizer enhances the disinfectant effect of chlorine by preventing rapid destruction from the sun’s UV rays. It’s the perfect complement for outdoor pools with salt electrolysis systems or unstabilized chlorine treatments.",
    PRODUCT4: "CTX-1596 Phosfree - 1L (63108). To eliminate excess phosphates, add 60 ml of CTX-1596 Phosfree with the filtration system running. This concentrated product will instantly eliminate phosphates generated by algae by inhibiting their growth, thus preventing new algae formation. It improves the performance of salt electrolysis systems and is easy to use with its dosing bottle.",
    PRODUCT5: "CTX-41 Flocculant - 5L (03117). For a shock treatment to remove particles causing cloudiness, add 0,5 L of CTX-41 Flocculant in a container with water and distribute evenly across the pool surface with the filtration system off. Its fast-acting formula will clarify the water, restoring transparency within a few hours. Wait a minimum of 8 hours before proceeding to the next step.",
    PRODUCT6: "CTX-37 Xtreme Floc (60044). To restore water clarity, add 2-3 tablets of CTX-37 Xtreme Floc. These slow-dissolving tablets completely remove suspended particles that are not retained by the filter, ensuring total transparency of the pool water.",
    PRODUCT7: "Manually vacuum the sediment and dispose of it directly down the drain without passing through the filter.",
    PRODUCT8: "Check pH and chlorine levels again, considering the recommended values, and make adjustments if necessary.",
    FLUIDRARECOMMEND: ""

  HISTORY2: {
    PRODUCT1: "CTX-20 pH Plus - 5kg (74895). To increase and adjust pH values to 7,5, add 1,5 kg of CTX-20 pH Plus. This will improve bathing comfort by preventing eye and mucous membrane irritation and preserving the skin's natural protective layer. It will also optimize disinfectant efficiency and prevent lime scale build-up.",
    PRODUCT2: "CTX-21 Alka Plus - 6kg (03212). Alkalinity plays an important role as it helps regulate pH fluctuations and corrects unstable pH when alkalinity is low. To adjust alkalinity levels between 125 and 150ppm, dissolve 11,7kg of CTX-21 Alka Plus in water and distribute this solution evenly over the pool surface.",
    PRODUCT3: "Perform filter cleaning. Run the filtration system in the wash phase for 2-3 minutes and in the rinse phase for 30-50 seconds. Verify that the pressure gauge is in the green zone. If it is in the yellow or red zones, it is recommended to repeat this cleaning process.",
    PRODUCT4: "CTX-400 ClorProtect - 4.5kg (73127). To keep the water disinfected for longer, pour 1kg of CTX-400 Clor Protect into the skimmer or pump prefilter while keeping the filtration system running. This chlorine stabilizer enhances the disinfectant effect of chlorine by preventing rapid degradation caused by ultraviolet sunlight. It’s the perfect supplement for outdoor pools with salt electrolysis systems or non-stabilized chlorine treatments.",
    PRODUCT5: "CTX-1596 Phosfree - 1L (63108). To eliminate excess phosphates with the filtration system running, add 60ml of CTX-1596 Phosfree. This concentrated product will immediately eliminate phosphates generated by algae, inhibiting their growth. It also prevents the appearance of new algae, improves the efficiency of salt electrolysis, and is easy to use thanks to its dosing bottle.",
    PRODUCT6: "Perform a salt analysis. When the salt level is equal to or higher than 5000 ppm, a specific salt analysis is recommended. This can be done with test strips (76646) or with an SD30 EC portable salinity meter (77189).",

    PRODUCT1: "CTX-51 WallCleaner Plus - 5L (03124). If you can empty the pool water, clean the pool walls with CTX-51 WallCleaner Plus. To perform this cleaning, it is recommended to: 1) Apply the product undiluted on surfaces to be cleaned using a sprayer, spreading it well over walls and bottom; 2) Let it sit for approximately 30 minutes and rinse thoroughly with plenty of water. If the buildup persists, repeat the operation. It is advisable to use a brush on areas with more intense buildup. This product features a special formula to remove lime, organic residues, and mineral sediments that form over time and adhere to the pool surfaces. If the pool cannot be emptied, proceed to the next step.",
    PRODUCT2: "CTX-10 pH Minus - 5kg (74650). To lower and adjust pH levels to 7,4, add 1,26kg of CTX-10 pH Minus. This will improve bathing comfort by preventing eye and mucous membrane irritation and preserving the skin's natural protective layer. It will also optimize disinfectant efficiency and prevent lime scale build-up.",
    PRODUCT3: "CTX-200GR ClorShock - 1kg (03135). To recover the water, perform superchlorination by adding 0,92kg of CTX-200GR ClorShock into the skimmer.
